It will be a diagram of entity associations for a database that gathers information about the chartering company. How many floating units and their specifications (number of places, patent / permits needed, equipment eg engine). Charter boat will be registered. The charterer is the helmsman who is in charge of the yacht. It includes employees who take the boat and receive it from the charterers. It is important to start and end the cruise, if it is damaged. After each cruise, data will be collected about the boat's journey through various ports.
